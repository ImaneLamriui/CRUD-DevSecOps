This CRUD application manages electronic component sales. It has been fortified with sanitization measures, parameterized queries, and other security enhancements to mitigate common vulnerabilities and risks associated with SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Open HTTP Redirect Vulnerability, and brute force attacks.
While the code has undergone some security improvements, further enhancements may be needed. Continuous vigilance and security assessments are recommended.

###### Although extensively commenting code is common practice in educational contexts for explanatory purposes, it's important to note that in real-world applications, excessive commenting can potentially introduce security risks. In professional environments, emphasizing clear and descriptive naming conventions for variables and functions, rather than relying heavily on comments, is crucial for security.
